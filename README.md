# CivilizationLands
 This plugin extends the functionality of the lands plugin specifically for the requirements of the CIVILIZATION minecraft project.

 It changes players colors and leaderboards, uses internal minecraft TEAMS to connect the players and uses a hook to the Discord API to inform every user about the changes made to a faction, which faction attacked whom, and provides functionality for managing in-game teams through discord.
